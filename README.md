## üíõ Introduction 
Kare4Kids is in the process of developing a comprehensive website that will feature separate login portals for two crucial roles: Social Workers and the Management team. 

üìå This platform aims to facilitate seamless collaboration and efficient operations within the organization. 

üìå The Social Worker login provides a dedicated space for members to fill in essential details about children and carry out the necessary processes to make them available for adoption. 

üìå Meanwhile, the Management team, consisting of the Case Management and Operation Management teams, assumes the responsibility of overseeing and coordinating the entire adoption process. 

üìå The Case Management Team will utilize their designated login to effectively manage the tasks assigned to Social Workers and ensure that they performs their duties to the highest standards. 

üìå Additionally, the Operation Management team will closely monitor the execution of tasks by both the Case Management team and Social Workers, ensuring that all operations are carried out smoothly and efficiently. 

Through this website, Kare4Kids aims to streamline the adoption process and provide optimal support for both Social Workers and the Management team, ultimately benefiting the children in their care.

## üí° Why?
By combining our empathy, passion, research, collaborative discussions, and inspiration from existing initiatives, we were able to conceptualize and develop a comprehensive approach to child donation and support. Our goal is to provide a platform that empowers individuals to make a difference and ensure that every child has access to love, care, and opportunities for a brighter future.
